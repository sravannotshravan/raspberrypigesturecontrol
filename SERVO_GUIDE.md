## 🔧 Converting Standard SG90 to Continuous Rotation

If you only have a standard SG90 servo, you can convert it:

### Required Tools:
- Small Phillips screwdriver
- Wire cutters or pliers
- Optional: Multimeter

### Conversion Steps:

1. **Open the Servo**
   - Remove the 4 screws on the bottom
   - Carefully separate the two halves
   - Note the gear arrangement

2. **Remove the Potentiometer**
   - The potentiometer (variable resistor) provides position feedback
   - Cut the wires to the potentiometer OR
   - Desolder it from the circuit board

3. **Set Potentiometer to Center**
   - Using a multimeter, find the center position
   - OR manually set it to middle position (~2.5V)
   - Alternatively, replace with fixed resistors (2.2kΩ each)

4. **Remove Physical Stops**
   - The main output gear has a small plastic tab
   - Carefully cut or file off this tab
   - This allows 360° rotation

5. **Reassemble**
   - Put gears back in order
   - Close the case
   - Screw it back together

6. **Test**
   - Connect to Raspberry Pi
   - Send neutral signal (7.5% duty cycle)
   - Servo should stop
   - Adjust if needed

### Wiring After Conversion:
```
Wire Color    Function
─────────────────────────
Orange/Yellow Signal (to GPIO 13)
Red          5V Power
Brown/Black  Ground
```

### Calibration:
The converted servo may not stop perfectly at 7.5% duty cycle. You may need to adjust the "neutral" value in the code:

```python
# In gesture_control_system.py, around line 198
# Adjust this value if motor doesn't stop at neutral
base_stop = 7.5  # Try 7.0-8.0 if needed
```

## 🔌 Wiring Continuous Rotation Servo

### Pin Connections (Same as Standard Servo):

```
Raspberry Pi 5          Continuous Rotation Servo

5V (Pin 2 or 4)     →   Power Wire (Red)
GND (Pin 6)         →   Ground Wire (Brown/Black)
```

## ⚙️ How Continuous Rotation Control Works

### PWM Signal Explanation:

| Duty Cycle | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| 5.0% | Full speed reverse (counterclockwise) |
| 7.5% | **STOP** (neutral position) |
| 10.0% | Full speed forward (clockwise) |

### Our Implementation:

```python
# Speed Level → Duty Cycle → Rotation Speed
Level 0: 7.5%  → Stopped
Level 1: 8.4%  → 20% forward speed
Level 2: 9.3%  → 40% forward speed
Level 3: 10.2% → 60% forward speed
Level 4: 11.1% → 80% forward speed
Level 5: 12.0% → 100% forward speed (maximum)
```

The motor continuously rotates when ON, getting faster as you increase the level.

## 🧪 Testing Your Servo

### Quick Test Script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

SERVO_PIN = 13

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(SERVO_PIN, GPIO.OUT)
pwm = GPIO.PWM(SERVO_PIN, 50)  # 50Hz

try:
    # Test 1: Stop (neutral)
    print("Test 1: Stopped (7.5%)")
    pwm.start(7.5)
    time.sleep(3)
    
    # Test 2: Slow forward
    print("Test 2: Slow forward (8.5%)")
    pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(8.5)
    time.sleep(3)
    
    # Test 3: Medium forward
    print("Test 3: Medium forward (10%)")
    pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(10)
    time.sleep(3)
    
    # Test 4: Fast forward
    print("Test 4: Fast forward (11.5%)")
    pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(11.5)
    time.sleep(3)
    
    # Stop
    print("Stopping...")
    pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(7.5)
    time.sleep(1)
    
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
finally:
    pwm.stop()
    GPIO.cleanup()
    print("Test complete!")
```

Save as `test_servo.py` and run:
```bash
sudo python3 test_servo.py
```

### Expected Behavior:
1. Motor should be stopped initially
2. Should start rotating slowly
3. Speed should increase progressively
4. Should stop at the end

### Troubleshooting Test Results:

**Motor doesn't stop at 7.5%:**
- Adjust the neutral value (try 7.0-8.0)
- Servo may need calibration
- Check if it's truly a continuous rotation servo

**Motor doesn't rotate:**
- Check wiring connections
- Verify 5V power supply
- Try external power supply
- Check if servo is damaged

**Motor rotates opposite direction:**
- That's okay! Some servos are wired differently
- Swap the duty cycle range in code (5-7.5% instead of 7.5-10%)

## 🔋 Power Considerations

### Current Draw:
- Continuous rotation servos draw more current than positional servos
- Expected: 100-500mA depending on load
- Peak: Up to 1A when starting or under load

### Power Options:

#### Option 1: Raspberry Pi 5V (Simple)
```
Pi 5V → Servo Red Wire
```
**Pros**: Simple, no extra hardware
**Cons**: May brownout Pi if servo draws too much current
**Good for**: Light loads, testing, small servos

#### Option 2: External 5V Power Supply (Recommended)
```
External 5V Supply → Servo Red Wire
Common Ground → Both Pi GND and Supply GND
```
**Pros**: Stable, no risk to Pi
**Cons**: Needs extra power supply
**Good for**: Production, heavy loads, multiple servos

### Recommended External Power:
- 5V 2A USB power adapter
- 4x AA battery pack (6V works fine)
- Bench power supply set to 5-6V

   - Use appropriate torque for your application
   - Secure servo to prevent movement

3. **Heat Management**
   - Servos get warm during continuous operation
   - Ensure adequate ventilation
   - Don't run at max speed for extended periods

4. **Wiring**
   - Double-check polarity before powering
   - Use proper gauge wire (22-24 AWG)
   - Secure connections to prevent shorts

## 📝 Code Configuration

### Adjusting Neutral Point:
If your servo doesn't stop at 7.5%, edit `gesture_control_system.py`:

```python
def set_servo_speed(self, level):
    # ... existing code ...
    base_stop = 7.5  # ← ADJUST THIS (try 7.0-8.0)
    # ... rest of code ...
```

### Adjusting Speed Range:
To change max speed:

```python
def set_servo_speed(self, level):
    # ... existing code ...
    base_stop = 7.5
    max_forward = 12.0  # ← ADJUST THIS (try 10.0-12.0)
    # ... rest of code ...
```

### Reverse Direction:
To make servo rotate opposite direction:

```python
def set_servo_speed(self, level):
    # ... existing code ...
    base_stop = 7.5
    max_reverse = 3.0  # Use reverse direction
    
    # Calculate for reverse
    speed_range = base_stop - max_reverse
    duty_cycle = base_stop - (self.motor_level / 5.0) * speed_range
    # ... rest of code ...
```

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Servo won't stop at neutral"
→ Adjust `base_stop` value in code (try 7.0-8.0)

### "Servo rotates but very slowly"
→ Increase `max_forward` value (try up to 12.0)

### "Servo jitters or buzzes"
→ Check power supply, add capacitor, secure wiring

### "Raspberry Pi reboots when servo runs"
→ Use external power supply for servo

### "Wrong rotation direction"
→ Swap duty cycle range in code (see "Reverse Direction" above)

**You're all set! Your continuous rotation servo will now work perfectly with the gesture control system.** 🎉
